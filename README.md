I have experience operating with different programming languages and frameworks, relational and non-relational databases, messaging queues and implementing software design patterns aligning with best practices and system design principles. Collaborating with multiple teams and projects simultaneously, communicating proficiently with different stakeholders, I have always ensured delivery of good quality software products on time, ones which can make a real impact.

Being a positive growth-minded individual, I am always interested in learning new technologies and applying them in real-world applications. Whether it's about potential opportunities, the latest tech trends, I'm always up for a chat. Do feel free to reach out.
